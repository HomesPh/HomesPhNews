        summary: 'The BPO sector continues to drive demand in key business districts, signaling a robust recovery for the commercial real estate market.',
        content: `
            <p>The office market in Metro Manila is showing strong signs of recovery as vacancy rates dip to their lowest levels since 2019. Major business districts like Makati CBD and Bonifacio Global City are seeing a resurgence in leasing activity.</p>
            <h3>BPO Sector leading the charge</h3>
            <p>The Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry remains the primary driver of office demand, accounting for over 60% of new transactions in Q4 2025. With many companies enforcing return-to-office mandates, physical workspace is once again at a premium.</p>
            <p>New supply entering the market in upcoming quarters is expected to be absorbed quickly, keeping rental rates competitive but stable.</p>
            <h3>Flight to Quality</h3>
            <p>Tenants are increasingly prioritizing premium, LEED-certified buildings that offer better amenities and sustainability features, leaving older Grade B buildings with higher vacancy rates.</p>

            <p>While the broader residential market faces headwinds from rising interest rates, the luxury segment remains remarkably resilient. Prices for prime condominium units in Metro Manila have increased by 8% year-on-year.</p>
            <h3>Foreign Demand</h3>
            <p>International buyers are returning to the market, attracted by potentially high rental yields and capital appreciation. The weakness of the local currency has also made Philippine real estate more attractive to dollar-holding investors.</p>
            <p>Developers are responding by launching ultra-luxury projects that offer hotel-like amenities and branded residences.</p>
